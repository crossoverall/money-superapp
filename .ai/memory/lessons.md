### 2026-09-27: Centralized Theme System & PWA Offline Integrity

- **Date & Context:** 2026-09-27, during theme unification across all 7 calculators and `index.html`.
- **Problem:**
  1. The app shell and multiple pages had visual discordance: four calculators used a minimalist Sage/Emerald palette, one used cool slate/indigo, and two used generic Tailwind blue/gray classes.
  2. Switching tabs caused jarring background flashes and inconsistent form controls/buttons.
  3. Two pages (`tax-calculator-base.html` and `months-slips.html`) contained external `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?...">` links, breaking offline PWA operation when running disconnected.
- **Root Cause:** Independent evolution of pages where CSS variables were embedded inline in `<style>` blocks in each file rather than imported from a single shared stylesheet.
- **Solution & Rule:**
  1. Centralized shared CSS custom properties into [`css/theme.css`](file:///home/l2okii/Documents/money-superapp/css/theme.css) and added `'./css/theme.css'` to `ASSETS_TO_CACHE` in [`sw.js`](file:///home/l2okii/Documents/money-superapp/sw.js).
  2. Rely strictly on system font stacks (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Prompt", sans-serif`) to ensure zero external CDN dependencies for offline PWA compliance.
  3. Whenever a new tool or shared styling is created, link `css/theme.css` and always run `node scripts/bump.mjs patch` so client service workers immediately fetch the updated asset cache.

### 2026-09-27: Stored XSS Guard & Shell Root Dataset Theme Binding

- **Date & Context:** 2026-09-27, during adversarial security and code review of theme unification.
- **Problem:**
  1. In `dashboard.html`, snapshot dates and IDs were directly interpolated into `innerHTML` and inline `onclick="deleteSnapshot(${s.id})"`. Since snapshots can be loaded from external backup JSON files, an attacker could inject malicious scripts.
  2. In `index.html`, `applyTheme()` toggled active classes on buttons but neglected to set `document.documentElement.dataset.theme = theme`. Consequently, the shell root never evaluated dark mode variables, causing light flashes during tab navigation.
  3. Five child calculators forwarded only `Alt+1..5` shortcuts instead of `Alt+1..7`, breaking shortcuts for Remaining Money (`Alt+6`) and Debt Calculator (`Alt+7`).
- **Root Cause:** Incomplete event delegation, lack of textContent sanitization for imported data, and legacy hardcoded shortcut boundaries.
- **Solution & Rule:**
  1. Always set dynamic data from storage via `.textContent` or sanitized DOM nodes, and bind event handlers using `.addEventListener()` with explicit type casting (`Number(s.id)`).
  2. In root shell files, ensure `document.documentElement.dataset.theme = theme` is called so child and parent CSS `:root[data-theme="dark"]` rules trigger predictably.
  3. Always forward all valid application tab shortcuts (`e.key >= '1' && e.key <= '7'`).

### 2026-09-27: SVG Tooltip XSS via Inline Attributes & Date Rollover Month-Skipping

- **Date & Context:** 2026-09-27, during adversarial audit of dashboard localization fixes.
- **Problem:**
  1. SVG chart point dots were dynamically built with stringified inline attributes `onmouseover="showChartTooltip(event, '${p.date}', ...)"`. A malicious date in `localStorage` executed arbitrary JavaScript.
  2. Target debt payoff date used `targetDate = new Date(); targetDate.setMonth(targetDate.getMonth() + approxMonths);`. When calculated on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of a month, dates rolling into shorter months (e.g. February or 30-day months) overflowed and skipped an extra month.
- **Root Cause:** Inlined JavaScript event handlers instead of event delegation, and failing to pin day of month to `1` prior to month arithmetic.
- **Solution & Rule:**
  1. Never construct inline event handlers (`onmouseover="..."`) inside dynamic SVG/HTML strings. Use `data-*` attributes with `escapeHtml()` and attach delegated event listeners on the SVG container.
  2. Always sanitize tooltip content via `escapeHtml()`.
  3. When calculating future month milestones, always pin to the 1st of the target month: `new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth() + months, 1)`.
