### 2026-09-27: Centralized Theme System & PWA Offline Integrity

- **Date & Context:** 2026-09-27, during theme unification across all 7 calculators and `index.html`.
- **Problem:**
  1. The app shell and multiple pages had visual discordance: four calculators used a minimalist Sage/Emerald palette, one used cool slate/indigo, and two used generic Tailwind blue/gray classes.
  2. Switching tabs caused jarring background flashes and inconsistent form controls/buttons.
  3. Two pages (`tax-calculator-base.html` and `months-slips.html`) contained external `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?...">` links, breaking offline PWA operation when running disconnected.
- **Root Cause:** Independent evolution of pages where CSS variables were embedded inline in `<style>` blocks in each file rather than imported from a single shared stylesheet.
- **Solution & Rule:**
  1. Centralized shared CSS custom properties into [`css/theme.css`](file:///home/l2okii/Documents/money-superapp/css/theme.css) and added `'./css/theme.css'` to `ASSETS_TO_CACHE` in [`sw.js`](file:///home/l2okii/Documents/money-superapp/sw.js).
  2. Rely strictly on system font stacks (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Prompt", sans-serif`) to ensure zero external CDN dependencies for offline PWA compliance.
  3. Whenever a new tool or shared styling is created, link `css/theme.css` and always run `node scripts/bump.mjs patch` so client service workers immediately fetch the updated asset cache.

### 2026-09-27: Stored XSS Guard & Shell Root Dataset Theme Binding

- **Date & Context:** 2026-09-27, during adversarial security and code review of theme unification.
- **Problem:**
  1. In `dashboard.html`, snapshot dates and IDs were directly interpolated into `innerHTML` and inline `onclick="deleteSnapshot(${s.id})"`. Since snapshots can be loaded from external backup JSON files, an attacker could inject malicious scripts.
  2. In `index.html`, `applyTheme()` toggled active classes on buttons but neglected to set `document.documentElement.dataset.theme = theme`. Consequently, the shell root never evaluated dark mode variables, causing light flashes during tab navigation.
  3. Five child calculators forwarded only `Alt+1..5` shortcuts instead of `Alt+1..7`, breaking shortcuts for Remaining Money (`Alt+6`) and Debt Calculator (`Alt+7`).
- **Root Cause:** Incomplete event delegation, lack of textContent sanitization for imported data, and legacy hardcoded shortcut boundaries.
- **Solution & Rule:**
  1. Always set dynamic data from storage via `.textContent` or sanitized DOM nodes, and bind event handlers using `.addEventListener()` with explicit type casting (`Number(s.id)`).
  2. In root shell files, ensure `document.documentElement.dataset.theme = theme` is called so child and parent CSS `:root[data-theme="dark"]` rules trigger predictably.
  3. Always forward all valid application tab shortcuts (`e.key >= '1' && e.key <= '7'`).

### 2026-09-27: SVG Tooltip XSS via Inline Attributes & Date Rollover Month-Skipping

- **Date & Context:** 2026-09-27, during adversarial audit of dashboard localization fixes.
- **Problem:**
  1. SVG chart point dots were dynamically built with stringified inline attributes `onmouseover="showChartTooltip(event, '${p.date}', ...)"`. A malicious date in `localStorage` executed arbitrary JavaScript.
  2. Target debt payoff date used `targetDate = new Date(); targetDate.setMonth(targetDate.getMonth() + approxMonths);`. When calculated on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of a month, dates rolling into shorter months (e.g. February or 30-day months) overflowed and skipped an extra month.
- **Root Cause:** Inlined JavaScript event handlers instead of event delegation, and failing to pin day of month to `1` prior to month arithmetic.
- **Solution & Rule:**
  1. Never construct inline event handlers (`onmouseover="..."`) inside dynamic SVG/HTML strings. Use `data-*` attributes with `escapeHtml()` and attach delegated event listeners on the SVG container.
  2. Always sanitize tooltip content via `escapeHtml()`.
  3. When calculating future month milestones, always pin to the 1st of the target month: `new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth() + months, 1)`.

### 2026-09-27: Client-Side CORS Market Data Fetching & Tab Visibility Auto-Refresh

- **Date & Context:** 2026-09-27, during implementation of real-time price fetching in `rebalance.html` (`v1.3.20`).
- **Problem:**
  1. Browser-based client-side SPA architectures cannot use standard server-to-server stock APIs because major US stock exchanges require licensed data and providers (Yahoo Finance, standard endpoints) block direct browser calls via CORS policies (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` missing).
  2. Public CORS proxies (e.g. `allorigins.win`, `corsproxy.io`) are fragile, frequently trigger anti-bot HTML challenge pages, and introduce security/privacy risks.
  3. Recurring `setInterval` auto-refreshers run continuously even when browser tabs are hidden or minimized, draining device battery and exhausting third-party API quotas.
- **Root Cause:** Fundamental architectural differences between open crypto exchanges (Coinbase/Binance) vs licensed equities, and unmanaged background timer lifecycles in single-page apps.
- **Solution & Rule:**
  1. For Crypto (BTC, ETH, etc.), use public CORS-enabled endpoints (Coinbase spot price) that require zero API keys and zero backend.
  2. For Forex (USD/THB), use free open CORS endpoints (Open Exchange Rates / ER-API) without API keys.
  3. For US Stocks/ETFs (NVDA, SGOV), support CORS-friendly providers (Finnhub, Twelve Data) by allowing users to store their own free API key in client `localStorage`, while providing manual price fallback.
  4. Always gate recurring auto-refreshers with `document.visibilityState === 'visible'` and attach a `visibilitychange` listener to catch up only when the tab regains focus if the refresh interval has elapsed.

### 2026-09-27: Multi-Currency Portfolio Normalization & Local Thai Asset Valuation

- **Date & Context:** 2026-09-27, during implementation of Thai assets support (`v1.3.21`) including `K-WORLDX`, `SCBCE`, and `YLG-GOLD`.
- **Problem:**
  1. Prior implementation assumed all assets with price and units were denominated in USD and multiplied by `usdThbRate`. Domestic Thai assets (`K-WORLDX`, `SCBCE`, `YLG-GOLD`) are denominated natively in Thai Baht (THB). Applying the FX rate inflated their portfolio value by ~33.4x.
  2. Thai mutual funds are unlisted OTC funds without open browser CORS APIs, requiring smooth manual NAV entry that integrates seamlessly with DCA allocation.
  3. Thai Gold (`YLG-GOLD`) trades in "Baht of Gold" (บาททองคำ), requiring live integration with Thai Gold Association quotes.
- **Root Cause:** Uniform single-currency assumption in asset modeling and lack of per-asset currency selector and ticker-prefix classification.
- **Solution & Rule:**
### 2026-09-27: Automated Full-Script Syntax Validation in Single-File Tools

- **Date & Context:** 2026-09-27, during syntax crash resolution in `rebalance.html` (`v1.3.22`).
- **Problem:** When editing inline `<script>` tags, an accidental omission of a closing brace `}` inside `renderBuckets()` caused an `Unexpected end of input` syntax error, completely halting page hydration in the browser.
- **Root Cause:** QA unit tests inspected extracted helper functions in isolation rather than parsing the complete verbatim `<script>` block from the HTML file.
- **Solution & Rule:**
  1. For single-file HTML tools with inline scripts, QA must always extract and compile the entire `<script>` block using `new vm.Script(scriptContent)` to guarantee zero syntax or parser errors.
  2. Perform a headless Chrome smoke check (`google-chrome --headless=new --remote-debugging-port`) to verify that the live browser environment boots with zero uncaught runtime exceptions and hydrates the DOM completely before signing off.
